I am planning to compare different methods for solving NLP (and eventually, OCP). I will start comparing [ACADO Toolkit](https://github.com/acado/acado), [CasADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi) and [ACADOS](https://github.com/acados/acados)

The supplementary source code can be found in [nlp_comparison](https://github.com/gmsanchez/nlp_comparison)
