# Add “SSH” File to the SD Card Root
Enable SSH by placing a file named “ssh” (without any extension) onto the boot partition of the SD card

# Add your Wi-Fi network before booting
Edit `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` and add the following

``network={
        ssid="YOUR SSID"
        psk="PASSWORD IN CLEARTEXT"
}``

If you don't want to save your Wi-Fi password in clear text, once the Raspberry Pi booted, you can run
``sudo su
wpa_passphrase "SSID" "PASSWORD" >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf``

and then edit `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` once again to remove the clear text password for the desired SSID.
